    static ==> does not depend on the object, and no object need to be created to access statics
    instance ==> depends on the object. there MUST be an object to use the instances in other class.
    And every time when an object created, a different memory will be allocated to that object, so it's better to use  static (single copy) variables &methods,
    if there is no need for the instance (multiple copy) variables & methods
