/* NOTE :  Equals method for custom classes

To give the customized conditions for the custom class objects to be equal
And in the original equal method you do not have the conditions that you wanted to check to see if two custom objects are equal
Thatâ€™s why you have to override and give them by yourself

we have always override in subclass correct?
-Yes. If each subclass requires different conditions to determine if they are equal
